# Shreddah

## a (partial) GNU shred(1) implementation in Golang

## Usage
```shreddah -h``` will show you the options
## Caveat Emptor
as stated in the man page of shred(1), there are a multitude of scenarioss where
shreddah (or shred(1) for that matter) will *NOT* yield the expected results.
Shreddah was coded mostly as coding training, in a quiet weekend, thus don't base
your anti-forensic strategy on it.
